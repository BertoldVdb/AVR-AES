# AVR-AES

This repository contains an implementation of AES (128, 192 and 256) written in assembly for AVR microcontrollers.

An example application is included. It runs a series of test vectors to verify the implementation.

makeasm.pl is a relatively dirty Perl script that generates the assembly code.
